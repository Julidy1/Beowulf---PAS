        <literal>Doucai (鬥彩 ‘joined or interlocking colours’), is a decorative technique in which porcelain painters outlined or half-outlined designs in blue pigment directly on to the biscuit (leather-hard porcelain body). Then they glazed and fired the generally small and delicate cups, bowls and dishes. Next they filled in and added the outlined designs over the glaze with yellow, red, green and aubergine enamel colours and refired them in a muffle kiln at a lower temperature. Potters first used this particular twice-fired technique in the early-fifteenth century but perfected it in the Chenghua era.</literal>

        <literal>Drawn glass beads are made by blowing a bubble into the molten gather or pushing a rod or other tool into the gather, attaching a rod to the opposite end of the gather and gradually pulling into a long continuous tube. This process is exhausting and involves several individuals over the course of several hours. The bubble forms the hollow centre and the tube is cut into lengths of about a metre which are then assigned to other workers who chop the tubes into small individual beads. The beads are usually heat-treated in order to finish the sharp ends: this is done by packing them in ash or sand to minimise them sticking together when they are re-heated and stirring them until the ends become smooth and rounded. They are then cleaned, sorted by size where necessary and in recent times were threaded for sale according to the weight of the bunch.

        <literal>The term refers to a technique for making beads which involved heating one or more small flat pieces of glass, bending them over a piece of wire and gently heating the junction(s) to fuse the edges: they may be recognised by this seam-like junction which runs parallel with the perforation. They are typically made from one piece of glass and therefore have a single seam (hence known as single-strip folded beads) but others are made by fusing two pieces of glass and therefore have two seams (double-strip folded beads). This is likely to be a very old tradition within the Middle East and is related to winding.

        <literal>Literally, 'pear-skin ground'; name given to two widely-used techniques invented in the Kamakura period. In one, large irregular shaped gold flakes are scattered at differing angles in many layers in wet 'nashiji urushi', a highly translucent lacquer that has been tinted orange; a further coating is applied and polishing exposes the flakes to produce an uneven surface texture. This technique is often used to give a uniformly decorative surface to large but less important areas, such as the interior of drawers or the underside of boxes. In the other, a fine metallic powder is sprinkled onto a lacquered surface; when dry, a coat of transparent lacquer is applied and lightly polished.

        <literal>A term that covers all types of painting in oils and fresco, and also finished works on paper of the schools of Asia.  For Western traditions of art, the word 'drawn' has been used for works on paper, including watercolours.

N.B.

The term is also used in the context of ceramics, where the object is described as, e.g.: 'painted in overglaze enamels', or 'decorated in overglaze enamels' (with the resulting Techniques 'glazed' and painted' and Material 'enamel').



For ceramics in the Greek and Roman Department, the term painted is also to be used in the sense of ‘decorated’. The composition of the ‘paint’, which can often be described as a ‘slip’ is irrelevant. Thus the term 'slip-painted' is not used for ceramics in that Department, and 'slipped' or 'painted' are used instead.</literal>

        <literal>This is the earliest known technique for making glass beads and similar objects such as spindle-whorls and entails dipping a lightly tapered thin metal rod known as a mandrel into a crucible containing molten glass inside the furnace. The mandrel is spun in order to build up a molten glass thread around the end: the object is then shaped or decorated by pressing against a flat or moulded surface or by impressing it with a paddle. Trails of a different colour can be easily applied at this stage. The mandrel cools and shrinks faster than the glass and therefore can be easily removed, leaving a slightly conical hole with bubbles orientated around the perforation, and the object is then allowed to cool slowly in an annealing chamber. This term has only been used in a small proportion of the object records.</literal>
