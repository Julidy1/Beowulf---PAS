<h2>Scheme research publications</h2>

<p>One of the recommendations of the 2012 Review of the Treasure Valuation Committee by the DCMS was that historic minutes of the Committee's 
meetings should be made available to the public once all of the cases discussed therein had been processed to their conclusion.  The Committee 
was happy to accept this recommendation and asked the Secretariat to make public these minutes when possible, ensuring that personal information 
and other sensitive information was appropriately redacted.  The Department of Portable Antiquities and Treasure has begun to prepare the minutes 
for publication accordingly, and you can find those available by following the links below.</p>
