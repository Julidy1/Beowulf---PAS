Portable Antiquities Scheme database source code
================================================

The Portable Antiquities Scheme is a DCMS funded project to encourage the voluntary recording 
of archaeological objects found by members of the public in England and Wales. Every year many 
thousands of objects are discovered, many of these by metal-detector users, but also by people 
whilst out walking, gardening or going about their daily work. Such discoveries offer an important 
source for understanding our past.
